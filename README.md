# React-code

Question 1:

Define an array of numbers (use any random numbers). Write a program to print only the even numbers of the array. Do not use any library functions, need to do via for loops only

Question 2:

Find the maximum consecutive 1's in an array of 0's and 1's.
Example:
a) 00110001001110 - Output :3 [Max num of consecutive 1's is 3]
b) 1000010001 - Output :1 [Max num of consecutive 1's is 1]

Question 3:

Suppose you have an array of 101 integers. This array is already sorted and all numbers in this array are consecutive. Each number only occurs once in the array except one number which occurs twice. Write a js code to find the repeated number.
e.g $arr = array(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8,9,10...................);

Question 4:

Let’s see we an api url www.example.com/api/get/1 
Write a sample code to call this rest api and display the result.

Question 5:

Assume there is a object of this format 
var obj = {
 “id” : 4, “name” : “abc”,
 “id” : 10, “name” : “ab2”,
 “id” : 5, “name” : “abc3”,
 “id” : 6, “name” : “abc5”
}
It can be a dictionary or java object, as per your language of choice. But its key/value pair dictionary simply.

Write a code to sort the object by id 
I.e final output should have objected sort by id’s


Todo App:

Make a simple todo app with reactJS, just need two features in the app 
1.To add a todo
2.To display all todo
